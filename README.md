# üè• Nigerian Healthcare Facilities Analysis

## üìö Project Overview

This project explores the distribution and accessibility of healthcare facilities across Nigeria. Using interactive dashboards and data analysis, it highlights regional disparities, ownership structures, and areas needing strategic healthcare investments.

---

## üéØ Project Objective

- Analyze the distribution and types of healthcare facilities across Nigerian states.
- Identify gaps in healthcare service accessibility.
- Support data-driven decision-making for policy development and resource allocation.

---

## üß† Methodology

- **Data Collection:** Healthcare facility datasets including location, ownership, category, and operational status.
- **Data Cleaning:** Standardized facility names, mapped locations, and removed duplicates.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzed healthcare facilities by state, type (Primary, Secondary, Tertiary), and ownership (Public/Private).
- **Visualization:** Built interactive dashboards using Power BI to showcase key patterns and gaps.

**Tools Used:**  
`Power BI`, `Excel`, `Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)`

## üìä Key Insights

- **Facility Concentration:** The South-West region has the highest concentration of healthcare facilities compared to other zones.
- **Ownership:** Public/government-owned facilities dominate, particularly in rural regions, while private sector facilities are more common in urban centers.
- **Service Gaps:** Rural northern regions show significant gaps in healthcare facility access.
- **Facility Type:** Primary healthcare centers dominate the landscape, with secondary and tertiary facilities mostly found in urban areas.
