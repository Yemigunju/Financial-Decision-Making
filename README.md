# üí∞ Financial Decision Making: Stock and Bond Valuation Analysis

## üìö Project Overview

This project explores stock and bond valuation techniques applied to major corporations, including Tesla, General Motors (GM), Apple, Google, and Amazon. It involves analyzing outstanding bonds, calculating bond prices based on current interest rates, evaluating premium or discount sales, and applying the Dividend Discount Model (DDM) for stock pricing. The objective is to enhance practical financial decision-making skills through real-world company data.

- **Bond Pricing:** Used current prime interest rates to calculate bond prices.
- **Premium/Discount Analysis:** Determined bond status (premium or discount) based on calculated prices relative to principal values.
- **Stock Valuation:** Applied the Dividend Discount Model (DDM) for GM using dividend, required return, and growth rates.
- **Market Comparison:** Compared calculated stock values with actual market prices to assess differences and influencing factors.

## üìä Key Insights

- **Bond Market Observations:**
  - All analyzed bonds (Tesla, GM, Apple, Google, Amazon) were selling at a **premium** based on current rates.
  - Factors such as inflation rates, principal values, coupon rates, discount rates, and company credit ratings significantly influenced bond prices.

- **Stock Valuation Insights:**
  - The calculated intrinsic value of GM stock using DDM was higher ($38.79) than the actual market value ($33.95).
  - Differences stemmed from market fluctuations, investor sentiment, methodology assumptions, data accuracy, and liquidity.

- **Financial Decision Factors:**
  - Beyond interest rates, bond price variations are affected by macroeconomic conditions, credit risks, and inflation expectations.
  - Stock market prices often reflect broader factors beyond fundamental valuation models.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

The project highlights the complexity behind financial decision-making in real-world contexts. Although models like bond pricing formulas and the Dividend Discount Model provide strong theoretical frameworks, actual financial markets are influenced by behavioral, economic, and sentiment-driven factors. An effective financial decision-maker must balance analytical techniques with market realities.
